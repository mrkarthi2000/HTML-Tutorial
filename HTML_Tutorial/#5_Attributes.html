    HTML ATTRIBUTES

        * All HTML elements can have attributs.
        * Attributes provide additional information about elements.
        * Attributes always specified Start Tag.
        * Attributes usually come in name/value pairs. like: name="value"

        <a href="Path URL"> Content... </a>

        There are two way to speicify the URL in the src attribute:
            *Absolute URL
            *Relative URL

            Absolute URL:
                -  Links to external image that is hosted on another website.
                -  Example : src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg"

                External image might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it.
            
            Relative URL:
                -  Links to image that is hosted within the image. Here, URL not include domain name. | src="img_girl.jpg"
                -  URL begins without slash, It will be relative to the Current page. | src="/images/img_girl.jpg"
                -  URL begins with slash relative to the domain.

                Finally, It's always best to use Relative URL. Reason, even domain change thats work.

        Alt Attributes:
            - alt attributes for the <img> tag specified the Alternative Text.
